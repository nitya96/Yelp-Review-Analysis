Yelp is a website or mobile app which offers a place for users to post reviews and rate products. According to a study, an increase of one star resulted in a 59% rise in income for small eateries. As a result, we believe that the Yelp dataset has enormous promise as a source of insightful data.

Our project's main goal is to thoroughly analyze distinct restaurant cuisine types like Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, French, and Italianâ€”find what things make a good restaurant and things customers care about, and then offer suggestions for future improvement and revenue growth. To be more precise, we'll mostly look at customer reviews to determine the primary reasons why people like or detest the restaurant. For instance, positive ratings may be mostly based on the welcoming service, while negative ones may be primarily based on the expensive price. In the meantime, we'll evaluate those seven various cuisines, identify variances from reviews, and acquire useful information to create individualized restaurant suggestions.

After the cleaning as well as the processing of this data, we can proceed to analyze the same and once this part is completed, we can make a conclusion of which restaurant is better to have dine with and which one is better to get take out order. With this analysis all the users who live in the same state or city or who are traveling from a different state or city can identify the good place to go and spend time with their family or friends.

This analysis is important for the restaurant as well the customers because none of the customers wants to have a bad experience when it comes to the food, and this will help a lot of customers to check the best places to go and also restaurants also want their rating to be on the top for their business. So, this review analysis will help both a lot.
